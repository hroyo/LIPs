## Abstract
The Lens Protocol aspires to become the leading consumer protocol meeting users where they are. 
While we value crypto we shouldn't expect our users to share the same enthousiam about it.

We are NOT competing with FARCASTER, we are competing with Web2 User Experience.

Polygon builds incredible backend tech. But we are consumer facing not backend facing. 
We need to be present a consumer-focused chain.

– A chain that will subsidise fees for users.
– A chain that will offer identity verification fees for users.
– A chain that already offers one-click payment rails.
– A chain that use vanilla ETH as native currency.
– A chain that offers wallet creation as well as the safest crypto exchange and custody services.

Let's go to Base and beyond
